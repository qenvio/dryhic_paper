2010). A. T47D breast cancer cell line (6 samples). B. K562 leukemia cell

tool. The data normalized by \textit{OneD} correlates better with the copy
number than the unnormalized data.}

    Capture Hi-C  data. Two Hi-C experiments were post-processed to produce an output
    similar to the Capture Hi-C experiment depicted in panels A and B. The signal
    outside the domain on chromosome 6 was removed and the data were
    normalized (capt), or the data were normalized before removing the signal
    outside the domain on chromosome 6 (full). Four matrices per method were
    generated and the Pearson (A) or Spearman (C) correlation computed between the
    pairs from different replicates were computed. Note that the scores are identical
    for the raw data because in this case the matrices of the same replicate are
    identical.}
