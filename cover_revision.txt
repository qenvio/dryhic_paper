Dear Madan Babu,
 
Please consider the revised version of our manuscript titled “OneD:  increasing reproducibility of Hi-C samples with abnormal karyotypes” for publication as a Method in Nucleic Acids Research.

We would like to thank the reviewers for their insightful comments. We have address them exhaustively. Following their suggestions, we have increased the number of samples analyzed (more than three-fold) and we have made a more thorough benchmark (including simulations). We also have studied the performance in capture-based experiments (i.e. capture Hi-C). Besides, we have added the copy number correction (OneD + CN) in every figure and we give a clearer message about when to use it.

All suggestions have reinforced OneD as robust method remove biases from Hi-C data.
